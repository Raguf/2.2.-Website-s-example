    <h1>SEASONS</h1>
    <br />
    <p class="seasos-text">
      A season is a division of the year based on changes in weather, ecology,
      and the number of daylight hours in a given region. On Earth, seasons are
      the result of Earth's orbit around the Sun and Earth's axial tilt relative
      to the ecliptic plane. In temperate and polar regions, the seasons are
      marked by changes in the intensity of sunlight that reaches the Earth's
      surface, variations of which may cause animals to undergo hibernation or
      to migrate, and plants to be dormant. Various cultures define the number
      and nature of seasons based on regional variations, and as such there are
      a number of both modern and historical cultures whose number of seasons
      varies.

    <h1>SPRING</h1>
    <br />
    <p class="spring-text">
      Spring, also known as springtime, is one of the four temperate seasons,
      succeeding winter and preceding summer. There are various technical
      definitions of spring, but local usage of the term varies according to
      local climate, cultures and customs. When it is spring in the Northern
      Hemisphere, it is autumn in the Southern Hemisphere and vice versa. At the
      spring (or vernal) equinox, days and nights are approximately twelve hours
      long, with daytime length increasing and nighttime length decreasing as
      the season progresses. Spring and "springtime" refer to the season, and
      also to ideas of rebirth, rejuvenation, renewal, resurrection and
      regrowth. Subtropical and tropical areas have climates better described in
      terms of other seasons, e.g. dry or wet, monsoonal or cyclonic. Cultures
      may have local names for seasons which have little equivalence to the
      terms originating in Europe.

    <h1>SUMMER</h1>
    <br />
    <p class="summer-text">
      Summer is the hottest of the four temperate seasons, occurring after
      spring and before autumn. At or centred on the summer solstice, the
      earliest sunrise and latest sunset occurs, daylight hours are longest and
      dark hours are shortest, with day length decreasing as the season
      progresses after the solstice. The date of the beginning of summer varies
      according to climate, tradition, and culture. When it is summer in the
      Northern Hemisphere, it is winter in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice
      versa.

    <h1>AUTUMN</h1>
    <br />
    <p class="autumn-text">
      Autumn, also known as fall in American English, is one of the four
      temperate seasons. Outside the tropics, autumn marks the transition from
      summer to winter, in September (Northern Hemisphere) or March (Southern
      Hemisphere). Autumn is the season when the duration of daylight becomes
      noticeably shorter and the temperature cools considerably. Day length
      decreases and night length increases as the season progresses until the
      Winter Solstice in December (Northern Hemisphere) and June (Southern
      Hemisphere). One of its main features in temperate climates is the
      striking change in colour for the leaves of deciduous trees as they
      prepare to shed.

    <h1>WINTER</h1>
    <br />
    <p class="winter-text">
      Winter is the coldest season of the year in polar and temperate climates.
      It occurs after autumn and before spring. The tilt of Earth's axis causes
      seasons; winter occurs when a hemisphere is oriented away from the Sun.
      Different cultures define different dates as the start of winter, and some
      use a definition based on weather. When it is winter in the Northern
      Hemisphere, it is summer in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa. In
      many regions, winter brings snow and freezing temperatures. The moment of
      winter solstice is when the Sun's elevation with respect to the North or
      South Pole is at its most negative value; that is, the Sun is at its
      farthest below the horizon as measured from the pole. The day on which
      this occurs has the shortest day and the longest night, with day length
      increasing and night length decreasing as the season progresses after the
      solstice.
